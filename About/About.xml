	<description>If you played Gravship scenario, you might have noticed that time to 'Incoming mechanoids' threat is extremely long, allowing you to build huge bases before mechs become a threat. This mod allows configuration of time rannge and strength of 'Incoming mechanoids' with custom, modified scenario. You can create more pressuring scenario to your liking, forcing you to leave as soon as it is possible. Or you can increase times to spend years in single place.</description>
